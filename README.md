# Static Node And Express Site

A basic portfolio site to showcase a few of the projects I've been working on. This is intended for me to practice a few skills such as Node.js, Express and Pug, setting up a server, handling requests, working with server-side JavaScript, and building a powerful and modern back end project.

A few changes to the layout:

- Body colour
- Text colour
- Font Family
- Hover effects
- Borders
- Added a logo
